## The Surge of Discord users


Before the disaster that 2019-2021 was, Discord did not have as big of a user base as it has now. The pandemic separated everyone from each other, and Discord was one of many platforms that brought people together. During this time, [Among Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us) was [one of many](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/covid19-coronavirus-pandemic-video-games-entertainment-media/) video games to explode in popularity, and Discord was the main way that many people were communicating with each other. Many big streamers began using Discord (if they weren't already) and their viewers hopped on the "trend" as well. But the way things have been looking, Discord was not prepared to handle the surge of users.

![Discord user growth graph](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/788198099067076638/974868119912845362/unknown.png "Graph provided by apptopia.com")



## How the malware works

Discord malware is nothing new, it has been around for many many years, most of which it has only consisted of things called "token loggers". Which were (usually) Windows Executable files, and when a user runs the EXE file it would typically look through these paths on the victim's PC:

```
roaming + '\\Discord',
roaming + '\\discordcanary',
roaming + '\\discordptb',
local + '\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default',
roaming + '\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable',
local + '\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\User Data\\Default',
local + '\\Yandex\\YandexBrowser\\User Data\\Default'
```

Due to the way that Discord tokens work, having MFA on your Discord account will not stop an attacker from controlling your account via token.

Once the malware has found what it's looking for, it will send the files or the contents of the files to a [Discord webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) or some sort of server that the attacker may have set up. From there, your account can now be controlled by the attacker.



## The evolution of Discord malware

So that's it, right? It just grabs a user's token and sends it to a webhook or server, then the attacker has what they want? Not anymore, unfortunately. Not too long after that the malware began to evolve, it began to grab more information than just a user's token. Things such as billing methods on the user's account, nitro gifts, and more were starting to be targeted as well. Sometimes the victim may even get infected with a [RAT (Remote Access Trojan)](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threats/remote-access-trojan-rat/), but this was a rare occurrence. During this evolution of Discord malware, there was a program known as *[AnarchyGrabber](https://youtu.be/QQ49ygeccLU),* which essentially was an all-in-one tool that makes it easier for attackers to infect other users. It even offered features such as:

* Disabling 2FA/MFA
* Grabbing the victim's password & token
* "Permanently" infecting a user's Discord installation

  * This allowed attackers to see the victim's new email/password/token when it would change
* And more

It was a dangerous tool, and attackers began to disguise a token logger as *[AnarchyGrabber](https://youtu.be/QQ49ygeccLU)* so more users would be deceived, and would run the tool.



## On platform phishing/spam

During the large user base boom and Discord's lack of preparation, many attackers began to use this to their advantage. Attackers would assumingly create fake user account to spread phishing links in large and/or popular Discord Guilds and in other users' DMs. This led to many **real** Discord accounts being compromised and taken over, they would then be used to spread more links. Friends of the compromised account would trust the link because it came from their friend, which led to their account being compromised as well, it is a vicious cycle.

There was absolutely nothing that Guild staff could do besides warn their users and use things such as [Dyno](https://dyno.gg) to help moderate their public chats. Dyno even implemented an AutoMod tool that allows Guild staff to take specific action against phishing links.

![Dyno's AutoMod tool to handle known phishing links](https://cdn.spin.rip/r/936a7718-4ce4-46d6-a010-3764fd16f5a1.png "Dyno's AutoMod tool to handle known phishing links")



## How did Discord respond?

It took Discord a bit of time to respond, but they responded somewhat well in my opinion. Discord began by putting out a [Blog post informing users about common scams](https://discord.com/blog/common-scams-what-to-look-out-for) and posting an announcement in their Discord Developer's guild

![Discord Developer's announcement](https://cdn.spin.rip/r/abea6472-ee48-44b9-849a-4af9aaeec144.png "Announcement warning and informing users about common scams")

Soon after that, Discord began to develop a built-in AutoMod and Content Filter feature that Guild staff can configure in their Guild settings. This feature has not been released as of the writing of this post, but this feature will solve many many issues.

![AutoMod settings for Discord Guilds](https://cdn.spin.rip/r/d866ddf8-0e36-4571-acb4-ba910b18e7d8.png "AutoMod settings for Discord Guilds")

![Content Moderation settings for Discord Guilds](https://cdn.spin.rip/r/228a1e31-5f5a-43c9-86ed-2fde78414168.png "Content Moderation for Discord Guilds such as specific words or phrases")

Not only have they started to work on AutoMod/Content Moderation, but Discord has also now begun to encrypt user tokens on the user's PC, which would render them useless to attackers, for now(?)



## Will this ever end?

The answer to this is most likely **no**. Pretty much every platform will have some amount of platform abuse no matter what, it's just the way that the internet is. This blog post does not cover every type of technique that attackers will use to infect users, but it covers the most common techniques. Many AntiVirus programs now are beginning to detect and properly label Discord malware as "TokenStealer", "DiscordStealer", or things similar to that.

It's not just Discord's responsibility to protect your account, it is also your own responsibility. Do not click on suspicious links from anyone, even your close friends. Do not blindly enter account information into websites without double (or triple) checking the URL, and most importantly, never **ever** run any programs that you receive in DMs.
